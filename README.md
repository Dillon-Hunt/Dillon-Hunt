# Dillon Hunt

## About Me
My name is Dillon Hunt, I am university student and I love programming. I like to create small websites & games in my spare time to improve my skills. I mainly focus on frontend development but I am trying to build my experience in full stack programming as well as getting used to frameworks like React.  You can visit my [website](https://dillon-hunt.com) to see more about my projects.
